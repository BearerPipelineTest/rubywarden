## bitwarden-ruby

A small, self-contained API server written in Ruby to provide a
private backend for the open-source
[Bitwarden apps](https://github.com/bitwarden).

Data is stored in a local SQLite database.

### API Documentation

This project also contains independent
[documentation for Bitwarden's API](https://github.com/jcs/bitwarden-ruby/blob/master/API.md)
written as I work on this server, since there doesn't seem to be any
documentation available other than the
[.NET Bitwarden code](https://github.com/bitwarden/core)
itself.
